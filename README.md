I have changed the compute histogram function, so it works with gray images, for dxdy and normalized hists, and i also slightly modified the dxdy_hist function,now it makes more sense to me.

I yet again change the dxdy_hist function, according to the prof's instructions. Now, when running the best neighbour function for dxdy histograms, the results look perfect. Remember that with dxdy, the model is not color-biased but more like shape-biased.
