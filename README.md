I have changed the compute histogram function, so it works with gray images, for dxdy and normalized hists

I yet again change the dxdy_hist function, according to the prof's instructions. Now, when running the best neighbour function for dxdy histograms, the results look perfect. Remember that with dxdy, the model is not color-biased but more like shape-biased.

change a small isue at the comute histograms function, so it works with the  grayvalue normalized histogram. also added part 3.c, but not finished, it needs A LOT of time to run, at least  for  parameters that i experimented

i  results for 3.c, for a sample of query images. chi2 distance function performs poorly and it was expected according to what the prof says, maybe it will not have accuracy 0 for the whole 89 images,but anyway it will be really small. 

added part 4.a
